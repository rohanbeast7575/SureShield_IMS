- User Management:
   -  User Registration and Login: Users can register for the system via the Frontend, with requests being handled by the User Service.
    - User data, including contact details, is stored in the User Service's MySQL database.
    - User Profile Management: After logging in, users can view their policies and manage their profiles (update details, view policies, etc.).

- Policy Application Process:
   - Admin Adds Policy: As shown in the second image, the admin creates and manages policies. This is done via the Policy Service, and the data is stored in the MySQL database.
  - Customer Applies for Policy: The customer views policies via the Frontend (React).When a customer applies for a policy, the request is routed through the API Gateway to the Policy Service.The application is saved in the Policy Service's MySQL database.
   - Approval by Admin:The admin approves or rejects the policy application, completing the policy creation workflow.

- Claims Submission and Processing:
  - Customer Submits a Claim:When a customer experiences an event covered by their policy, they can submit a claim through the Frontend.The claim request is routed via the API Gateway to the Claim Service.The claim details are saved in the Claim Service's MySQL database.
  - Assigning a Surveyor:According to the business flow image, after a claim is submitted, a surveyor is assigned to inspect the claim.This assignment is managed by the Claim Service and the surveyorâ€™s details are linked to the claim.
  - Surveyor Inspects and Approves/Rejects the Claim: The surveyor conducts an investigation and either approves or rejects the claim based on their findings. The claim status is updated in the Claim Service and stored in its database.
  - Customer Notified: If approved, the customer is notified and the settlement process is triggered. If rejected, the customer is informed of the rejection and the claim is closed.

## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a passionate Java Backend Developer with hands-on experience in designing, developing, and deploying Spring Boot microservices for large-scale applications. I have worked extensively with Spring Boot, Spring Security, and JPA, building secure, efficient RESTful APIs. My skill set includes working with Docker and Docker Compose to containerize and orchestrate microservices, enabling seamless deployment and scaling of applications.

Throughout my career, I've been involved in creating distributed systems, leveraging tools like Eureka for service discovery and API Gateway for centralized routing. I am also adept at handling inter-service communication using RestTemplate, Feign Client, and message brokers like RabbitMQ and Kafka for asynchronous communication.

In addition, I have experience with Redis for caching and session management in distributed systems, as well as integrating cloud storage solutions like AWS S3 into Spring Boot applications. I am always focused on optimizing performance, enhancing scalability, and ensuring the security of applications.

Currently, I am deepening my expertise in Docker to streamline the deployment process for microservices architectures and to manage infrastructure more efficiently.

I am always eager to learn new technologies and work on challenging projects that require innovative solutions. If you're looking for someone who is passionate about backend technologies and containerization, letâ€™s connect!
